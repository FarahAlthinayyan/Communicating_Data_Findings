# Communicating_Data_Findings



## The Goal

The main goal of this project is to understand this dataset, eventually, find information that can improve the service. In addition, this will help me practice my newly gained skills in exploring and representing data in the best way possible. 



## The Data 

I chose the Bay Wheels bicycle sharing service. This service is provided to support bicycling as an alternative transportation option. Bicycling is a great way to save the Earth from global warming, and a good sport.



## Throughout Exploration 

I started out by cleaning the dataset because if the data isn't clean, our findings might be faulty or inaccurate. Then I tried to understand the following:

- Why very few users share their trips 
- Why there are so few customers in comparasion to subscribers
- I also tried to find the best time to do the following
    - Update the system 
    - To implement maintainance procedures. 
- I wanted to check how successful the service is across time.


I included all my findings in detail in the Notebook, but to wrap it all up, I can point out the following:

- There are a lot of possible explanations for why there are few customers and very few whom share their trips. Mainly, people should know about the "sharing trip" feature so that they can motivate others to join
- Also, it would be the best choice to preform all maintainance procedures and updates at night or office hours. 
- I think it is safe to say that this service is doing a good job and has a promising future. 



## Needed Installations
I used Python in this project. Installing pip is essential, you can find more [here].(https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-pip-windows) 

Also, I used the following libraries:
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* seaborn


The implementation of this project is through Jupyter Notebook.
